# Round about

This project is dedicated to solution of the most significant problem of humanity named THE GREAT QUEUE PROBLEM.

You don't know what is it? Don't make me laught, dummy. 
All of us face this everyday, everywhere and everytimes.
The hierarchical model of society subordinates us and forces us to establish THE ORDER.

THE ORDER is the law of our world. Even chaos is subject to THE ORDER of the universe, therefore we are all the more subject to him.
We line up queues, thereby forming order, but we do it without THE JUSTICE.

So the main goal of this project is to provide an effecient engine to maintain THE ORDER and THE JUSTICE at the same time and the same place.
Our goal is clear, our determination is unshakable, and knowledge and opportunities inevitably bring our cause closer to triumph.
This is our fight, our war, and we will never lose in it.
